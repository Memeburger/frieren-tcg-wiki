# Frieren vs Stark: Analysis Stacking Guide

This guide covers how to effectively play Frieren against Stark by maximizing your Analysis stacks.

## Key Strategy

When facing Stark, your goal is to build Analysis stacks while avoiding his high-damage attacks. Stark's moves often require Resolve stacks, which gives you windows of opportunity.

### Early Game (Turns 1-3)

1. Focus on using **Barrier Magic Analysis** and **Demon Magic Analysis** to build Analysis stacks
2. Save your **Ordinary Defensive Magic** for when Stark has 2+ Resolve stacks
3. Avoid using offensive spells until you have at least 8 Analysis stacks

### Mid Game (Turns 4-7)

1. If Stark has used **Lightning Strike** or **Eisen's Axe Cleave**, he'll be low on Resolve
2. This is your opportunity to use **Judradjim** with your accumulated Analysis stacks
3. Continue building Analysis with utility cards when possible

### Late Game (Turns 8+)

1. Save **The Height of Magic** for when Stark is below 40 HP
2. Use **Field of Flowers** to sustain yourself if you're below 50 HP
3. If you're below 25 HP, consider using **The Height of Magic** as a finisher

## Card Priority

1. **Barrier Magic Analysis** - Build stacks while reducing Stark's defense
2. **Ordinary Defensive Magic** - Save for Stark's high-damage turns
3. **Judradjim** - Your main damage dealer with 8+ Analysis stacks
4. **The Height of Magic** - Finisher move

Remember that Stark's **Fear Brought Me This Far** becomes stronger when he's below 60 HP, so try to either finish him quickly or keep him above that threshold.
