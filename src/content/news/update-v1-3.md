    -   Check out her character info on `/tcg-info character` for more information!

-   **Wirbel**:
    -   Wirbel's a tactical character, who gets stronger, and resolves himself more, the harder he is attacked by the opponent.
    -   Ehre and Scharf also appears besides him to help him out in his battle!
    -   Check out his character info on `/tcg-info character` for more information!

-   **Flamme**:
    -   Flamme's kit revolves around her theorizing, incantation and research to achieve the Pinnacle of Human's Magic.
    -   Flamme's theories and cards affect the entire game for both players, so be sure to make use of the effect well to buy you time for your research!
