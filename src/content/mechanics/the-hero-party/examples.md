### The Hero Party Examples

**Example 1: Single Hero Party Member**

1.  Himmel plays a card that creates a timed effect representing Frieren.
2.  When Himmel attacks, his base damage is increased by the set percentage for having one active Hero Party member.

**Example 2: Multiple Hero Party Members**

1.  Himmel has an active timed effect representing Heiter.
2.  He then plays another card that creates a timed effect representing Eisen.
3.  When Himmel attacks, his base damage is increased by double the set percentage, as there are two active Hero Party members (Heiter and Eisen).

**Example 3: Expired Timed Effect**

1.  Himmel has an active timed effect representing Frieren. He gains the damage bonus.
2.  The duration of the Frieren timed effect expires at the end of the turn.
3.  On Himmel's next attack, he no longer receives the damage bonus, as there are no active Hero Party timed effects.

**Example 4: Multiple Instances of the Same Member**

1.  Himmel has two active timed effects, both originating from different cards but both representing Frieren.
2.  Himmel's attack damage is only increased by the single set percentage, as only the unique representation of Frieren counts towards the bonus.

**Example 5: Hero Party as Persistent Units**

1.  Himmel has a card that summons Frieren as a persistent unit on the board (not a timed effect).
2.  This persistent Frieren does not contribute to Himmel's The Hero Party damage bonus. The bonus only applies to active *timed effects*.
3.  If Himmel also has a *timed effect* representing Heiter, he would receive the damage bonus for Heiter, but not for the persistent Frieren.
