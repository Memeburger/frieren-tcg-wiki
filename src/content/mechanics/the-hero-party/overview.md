### The Hero Party

The Hero Party mechanic defines Himmel's unique synergy with his companions: Frieren, Heiter, and Eisen. When these characters are active as timed effects, Himmel's offensive capabilities are significantly enhanced.

The core effect of The Hero Party is:

- For each active timed effect originating from a card representing Frieren, Heiter, or Eisen, Himmel's attack damage is increased by a set percentage (specific percentage determined by game balance).

This mechanic encourages players to build strategies around summoning or maintaining the presence of Himmel's allies to maximize his damage output.
