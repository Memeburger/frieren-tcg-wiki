### Proctor (Observation)

Proctor, also known as Observation, is Sense's unique mechanic that allows her to achieve victory through strategic non-aggression. Sense accumulates Observation stacks by refraining from attacking, and reaching a certain number of stacks results in an alternate win condition.

The core mechanics of Proctor are:

-   At the end of Sense's turn, if she did not attack, she gains 1 Observation stack.
-   Whenever Sense attacks, she loses a certain number of Observation stacks (specific number determined by game balance).
-   If Sense accumulates a predefined number of Observation stacks, she wins the game.

This mechanic encourages a control-oriented playstyle, where Sense focuses on defense and disruption rather than direct offense.
