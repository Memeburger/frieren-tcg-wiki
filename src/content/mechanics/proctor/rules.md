### Proctor (Observation) Rules

1.  **Stack Acquisition:**
    * Sense gains 1 Observation stack at the end of her turn *only if* she did not perform any attack actions during that turn.
    * Using non-attack actions does not prevent stack gain.

2.  **Stack Loss:**
    * Whenever Sense performs an attack action, she loses a predetermined number of Observation stacks.
    * The number of stacks lost may vary depending on the specific attack card played.

3.  **Win Condition:**
    * If Sense accumulates the required number of Observation stacks, she immediately wins the game.
    * This win condition overrides any other win conditions.

4.  **Simultaneous Effects:**
    * If Sense would both gain and lose Observation stacks simultaneously (e.g., from a card effect), the loss occurs before the gain.

5.  **Interaction with other effects:**
    * Effects that prevent Sense from attacking can be crucial for accumulating Observation stacks.
    * Effects that manipulate the number of Observation stacks Sense has are possible, but should be carefully balanced.

6.  **Edge Cases:**
    * If Sense is forced to attack (e.g., by a card effect), she still loses Observation stacks.
    * If an attack is interrupted or canceled, Sense still loses Observation stacks.
