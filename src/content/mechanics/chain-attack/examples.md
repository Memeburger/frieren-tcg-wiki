### Chain Attack Examples

**Example 1: Building a Chain**

1.  It is Linie's turn. She has 0 Chain stacks.
2.  Linie uses an attack card. She deals damage and gains 1 Chain stack.
3.  Linie uses another attack card. Her damage is increased by the Chain stack, and she gains another stack (now 2).
4.  Linie continues to attack, with her damage increasing with each stack.

**Example 2: Chain Reset**

1.  Linie has 3 Chain stacks.
2.  On her turn, she uses a defensive card and does not attack.
3.  At the end of her turn, her Chain stack count is reset to 0.

**Example 3: Multiple Attacks in a Turn**

1.  Linie has 0 Chain stacks.
2.  She plays a card that allows her to attack three times this turn.
3.  Her first attack deals base damage. She gains 1 stack.
4.  Her second attack deals increased damage (with 1 stack), and she gains another stack (now 2).
5.  Her third attack deals even more damage (with 2 stacks), and she gains a third stack.

**Example 4: Attack Interruption**

1.  Linie has 1 Chain stack.
2.  She uses an attack card, but the attack is countered or interrupted by the opponent before dealing damage.
3.  Linie still gains a Chain stack, even though the attack did not deal damage.
