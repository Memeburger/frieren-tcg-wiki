### Chain Attack

Chain Attack is a core mechanic for Linie that rewards aggressive, consecutive attacks. By stringing together attacks, Linie can build up significant damage output. However, this comes with the risk of being vulnerable if the chain is interrupted.

The core mechanics of Chain Attack are:

-   After Linie uses an attack, she gains 1 Chain stack.
-   Chain stacks increase the damage of all attacks by a set percentage per stack (specific percentage determined by game balance).
-   When Linie does not attack in a turn, her Chain stack count is reset to 0.

This mechanic encourages aggressive play and creates a risk/reward dynamic where players must decide between continuing their chain or using utility cards.
