### Chain Attack Rules

1.  **Stack Acquisition:**
    * Linie gains 1 Chain stack immediately after an attack action resolves.
    * Effects that grant additional attacks in the same turn will trigger additional Chain stack gains.

2.  **Damage Bonus:**
    * The damage bonus is multiplicative and applied to the base damage of each of Linie's attacks.
    * The percentage increase per Chain stack is a fixed value defined by game balance.

3.  **Stack Reset:**
    * If Linie does not perform an attack action during her turn, her Chain stack count is reset to 0 at the end of that turn.
    * Using non-attack actions, such as defensive cards or utility spells, will trigger the reset if no attack is made during the turn.

4.  **Maximum Stacks:**
    * There might be a maximum limit to the number of Chain stacks Linie can accumulate. If so, any attempt to gain stacks beyond this limit has no effect.

5.  **Interaction with other effects:**
    * The damage bonus from Chain Attack is typically multiplicative with other damage modifiers unless specified otherwise.
    * Effects that prevent damage or reduce damage are applied after the Chain Attack damage bonus is calculated.

6.  **Edge Cases:**
    * If Linie's attack is interrupted or canceled before dealing damage, she still gains a Chain stack.
    * If Linie performs multiple attacks in a single turn, the damage bonus is recalculated for each attack based on the current number of Chain stacks.
