### Analysis Rules

1.  **Stack Acquisition:**
    * Analysis stacks are gained at the very end of Frieren's turn. If an effect causes Frieren's turn to end prematurely, the stack for that turn is not gained.
    * Cards with effects that grant Analysis stacks do so immediately upon resolution of the card's effect.

2.  **Damage Bonus:**
    * The damage bonus from Analysis stacks is calculated just before the damage of an attack is applied.
    * The percentage increase per stack is a fixed value defined by game balance.
    * The damage bonus applies to the base damage of the attack.

3.  **Stack Reset:**
    * Analysis stacks are reset to zero immediately after an attack initiated by Frieren resolves, regardless of whether the attack hits or deals damage.
    * Defensive actions or other non-attack card uses do not reset Analysis stacks.

4.  **Maximum Stacks:**
    * Frieren cannot accumulate more than the defined maximum number of Analysis stacks. Any attempt to gain stacks beyond this limit has no effect.

5.  **Interaction with other effects:**
    * The damage bonus from Analysis stacks is typically multiplicative with other damage modifiers unless specified otherwise.
    * Effects that prevent damage or reduce damage are applied after the Analysis damage bonus is calculated.

6.  **Edge Cases:**
    * If Frieren performs multiple attacks in a single turn (due to card effects), the Analysis stacks are reset after each individual attack.
    * If an attack is interrupted or canceled before damage is dealt, the Analysis stacks are still reset.
