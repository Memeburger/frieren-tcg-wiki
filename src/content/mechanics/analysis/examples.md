### Analysis Examples

**Example 1: Building and Using Stacks**

1.  It is the beginning of Frieren's turn. She has 0 Analysis stacks.
2.  Frieren uses a utility card. Her turn ends.
3.  At the end of her turn, Frieren gains 1 Analysis stack.
4.  On her next turn, Frieren uses a card with the "Analysis" tag. She gains 2 additional Analysis stacks, bringing her total to 3.
5.  Frieren then uses an attack card. This attack deals its base damage plus an additional amount based on her 3 Analysis stacks (e.g., 10% bonus per stack = 30% bonus damage).
6.  After the attack resolves, Frieren's Analysis stacks are reset to 0.

**Example 2: Reaching Maximum Stacks**

1.  Frieren has accumulated the maximum number of Analysis stacks (e.g., 5).
2.  At the end of her turn, she would normally gain another stack, but because she is at the maximum, her stack count remains at 5.

**Example 3: Multiple Attacks**

1.  Frieren has 2 Analysis stacks.
2.  She plays a card that allows her to perform two attacks this turn.
3.  Her first attack deals bonus damage based on her 2 stacks. Immediately after this attack, her Analysis stacks are reset to 0.
4.  Her second attack deals only its base damage, as she has no Analysis stacks remaining.

**Example 4: No Attack**

1.  It is Frieren's turn. She has 1 Analysis stack.
2.  She uses a defensive card and ends her turn without attacking.
3.  At the end of her turn, she gains another Analysis stack, bringing her total to 2. Her previous stack was not reset because she did not attack.
