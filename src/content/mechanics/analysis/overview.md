### Analysis

Analysis is Frieren's core mechanic, allowing her to build up power over time. By strategically using "Analysis" moves and waiting, Frieren can unleash devastating attacks.

There are two primary ways to gain Analysis stacks:

- At the end of each of Frieren's turns, she gains 1 Analysis stack.
- Certain cards with the "Analysis" tag will grant 2 Analysis stacks upon use.

The effects of Analysis stacks are as follows:

- For each Analysis stack Frieren has, her attack damage is increased by a percentage (specific percentage determined by game balance, as of now `5%`).
- After Frieren uses an attack, all accumulated Analysis stacks are reset to 0.
- There is a maximum number of Analysis stacks Frieren can hold. (As of now, this is `20`.)

This mechanic encourages a strategic approach, balancing the need to build up power with the opportunity to strike.
