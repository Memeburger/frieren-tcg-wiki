### Preserverance

Preserverance is a unique survival mechanic primarily associated with the character Denken. It represents his tenacity and will to keep fighting even when critically injured. Instead of being defeated immediately upon reaching 0 Hit Points (HP), a character with Preserverance can continue to act by consuming Preserverance stacks under specific conditions.

This mechanic introduces a high-risk, high-reward playstyle, as some character abilities or card effects might change or become active when their HP is low, leveraging the extended survival granted by Preserverance.
