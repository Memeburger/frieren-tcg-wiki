### Graze Examples

**Example 1: High Speed Advantage**

1.  Laufen has 80 SPD. The attacking enemy has 30 SPD. The SPD difference is 50.
2.  A D100 roll results in 10.
3.  Based on the game's Graze formula (or table), this combination of high SPD difference and low roll results in a significant damage reduction (e.g., 80%).
4.  The enemy's attack deals significantly reduced damage to Laufen.

**Example 2: Low Speed Advantage**

1.  Laufen has 50 SPD. The attacking enemy has 45 SPD. The SPD difference is only 5.
2.  A D100 roll results in 90.
3.  This combination of low SPD difference and high roll results in a small damage reduction (e.g., 10%).
4.  Laufen takes almost the full damage of the attack.

**Example 3: Speed Debuff**

1.  Laufen has 60 SPD. The enemy has 40 SPD.
2.  The enemy uses a card that reduces Laufen's SPD by 20.
3.  Laufen's SPD is now 40, and the SPD difference is 0.
4.  When the enemy attacks, the Graze mechanic provides minimal or no damage reduction, as there is no SPD advantage.

**Example 4: Multiple Attacks**

1.  Laufen is targeted by two separate attacks in the same turn.
2.  For each attack, a separate D100 roll is performed, and the SPD difference is calculated at the moment each attack resolves.
3.  Laufen may receive different levels of damage reduction from each attack.

**Example 5: Minimum Damage**

1.  Laufen has a very high SPD and opponent rolls a 0 on the D100.
2.  The Graze calculation results in a very high damage reduction (e.g., 100%).
3.  Laufen takes 0% of the opponent's attack damage.
