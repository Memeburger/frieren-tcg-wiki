### Empathy

Empathy is Ubel's unique and complex mechanic, reflecting her ability to understand and mimic her opponents. This mechanic has two key components: the ability to learn and use the opponent's signature move, and attacks with varying degrees of accuracy.

The core mechanics of Empathy are:

-   After a set number of turns have passed in a match against a specific opponent, Ubel gains the ability to use that opponent's unique "signature move." This copied move functions according to its original rules.
-   Ubel's own attacks have varying levels of accuracy. Some attacks might have a chance to miss entirely, while others might have conditional accuracy based on game state or other effects (like Ubel's "Rushdown").

This mechanic makes Ubel a highly adaptable character whose playstyle evolves based on the opponent he faces, introducing an element of unpredictability to her offense.
