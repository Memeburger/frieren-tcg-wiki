### Empowerment

There are 2 ways a card can be empowered.

-   If a card is not used during the round, it receives Empower+1.
-   If the result of the 4d6 lands on a duplicate card, the card receives Empower+1 per duplication.

Empower level remains permanent until the end of the game, even after reshuffling.

### Card Effect

A card's effect is the **bolded** values on the card's description. These are the only values affected by Empowerment on a card.

### Empowerment Effect

Increases the **effect** of the card by (**empower level**)\*10%.
