### Goddess' Blessing Examples

**Example 1: Increasing Healing**

1.  At the start of the game, Sein's healing spell heals for 5 HP.
2.  At the start of Sein's first turn, the healing amount increases by 2, now healing for 7 HP.
3.  At the start of Sein's second turn, the healing amount increases by another 2, now healing for 9 HP.
4.  This continues throughout the game, with Sein's healing becoming stronger each turn.

**Example 2: Overhealing**

1.  Sein has 98 HP remaining and a maximum HP of 100.
2.  He uses a healing ability that, due to Goddess' Blessing, heals for 6 HP.
3.  He now has 104 HP.
