### Goddess' Blessing Rules

1.  **Base Healing:**
    * All of Sein's healing abilities have a base healing value. This is the minimum amount they will heal for.

2.  **Healing Increase:**
    * At the end of each of Sein's turns, the healing amount of all of his healing abilities is permanently increased by the defined value.
    * This increase is cumulative.

3.  **Healing Timing:**
    * The healing increase is applied before the healing effect resolves.

4.  **Overhealing:**
    * Sein can be healed above his maximum HP.

5.  **Interaction with other effects:**
    * Effects that increase or decrease healing effectiveness apply to the total healing amount (base + turn-based increase).
    * Effects that prevent healing will prevent both normal and temporary HP gain.

6.  **Edge Cases:**
    * None that I know of.
