### Goddess' Blessing

Goddess' Blessing is Sein's unique healing mechanic, representing his growing power to mend and protect. This mechanic allows Sein's healing abilities to become more potent as the game progresses, and even allows him to exceed his normal maximum HP.

The core mechanics of Goddess' Blessing are:

-   Sein's healing effects heal for a base amount.
-   This base healing amount is increased by a value dependent on the turn number at the end of each of Sein's turns (specific value determined by game balance).
-   Sein can be healed above his maximum HP.

This mechanic makes Sein a powerful sustain character, becoming incredibly difficult to defeat as the game goes on.
